## ℹ️ General info

The main purpose of creating this game was to strengthen my C# programming skills and get to know [Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine. I was following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8YUfee_pzc), nearly 8-hour tutorial on YouTube (I've made a few of my own minor changes and tweaks after finishing, so it's not exactly the same as in the video).
